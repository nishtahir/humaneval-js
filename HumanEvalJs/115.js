/**
 * You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
 * and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
 * Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it,
 * and all buckets have the same capacity.
 * Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
 * Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *     Input:
 *         grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
 *         bucket_capacity : 1
 *     Output: 6
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input:
 *         grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
 *         bucket_capacity : 2
 *     Output: 5
 *
 * Example 3:
 *     Input:
 *         grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
 *         bucket_capacity : 5
 *     Output: 0
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     * all wells have the same length
 *     * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
 *     * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
 *     * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
 *     * 1 <= capacity <= 10
